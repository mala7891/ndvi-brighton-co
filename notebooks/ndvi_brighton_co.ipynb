    "# Visualizing Percent Change in NDVI Land Cover to Measure Vegetation Health in Brighton, Colorado\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "An unhealthy environment vulnerable to flash floods, wildfires, and droughts can worsen the impacts of climate change by reducing the landscape's ability to absorb and retain water, increasing erosion and soil degradation. This can lead to a loss of vegetation, biodiversity, and wildlife habitats, which can further degrade the ecosystem and exacerbate the impacts of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding past conditions is crucial for a municipality’s informed decision-making and effective resource management, such as which practices to prioritize, and how to effectively monitor and evaluate progress towards sustainability and climate resilience goals. This knowledge can enhance our understanding of management strategies that balance conservation and resource use, while maintaining ecosystem services and resilience to environmental changes, ultimately promoting a healthier and more sustainable city.\n",
    "\n",
    "My aim as a horticulturist working for the City of Brighton, Colorado is to enhance the historical and ecological understanding of the landscape by analyzing a curated list of environmentally sensitive areas found throughout the city. This will enable decision-makers to make informed choices about how these properties can withstand the immediate effects of climate change.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other similarly related examples of efforts on this topic area include a paper on using NDVI for greenness exposure assessments and policy interventions in urban greening:\n",
    "https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0013935122024823#cebib0010\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, a link is provided for NASA Scientific Visualization System’s article on NDVI anomalies revealing areas of likely drought in Colorado: \n",

    "## Study Area\n",
    "Brighton, Colorado is a city located in Adams County, situated approximately 20 miles northeast of downtown Denver and covers an area of approximately 21 square miles. The area has experienced a significant population boom in recent years, with a current population of around 41,000 people. This growth has been driven by a combination of factors, including its proximity to Denver, a strong local economy, and affordable housing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the rapid urbanization and development of Brighton, the area has managed to preserve its agricultural roots. The region boasts numerous farms and ranches, which contribute to the local economy while maintaining the connection to the city's rich agricultural heritage. With a semi-arid climate characterized by hot summers and cold winters, the area has long been an ideal location for growing crops such as corn, wheat, and alfalfa.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the rapid growth and development of the area have put significant pressure on the local ecosystem. The natural habitats of prairie grasslands, wetlands, and riparian areas have been threatened by the expansion of urban areas and agricultural lands, leading to a decline in biodiversity and ecological health. To counteract this trend, the city has taken steps to protect these ecological features, including the establishment of conservation easements and other preservation measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the long-term sustainability of the region, it is important to implement sustainable land use management practices. Research into best practices for ecological, social, and economic sustainability can provide valuable insights to guide decision-making and resource management. Through the integration of sustainable practices, Brighton can continue to thrive as a vibrant community while maintaining its connection to its agricultural heritage and natural surroundings.\n"

    "## Methods\n",
    "The purpose of this project is to collect and analyze data to visualize and measure drought indicators from 1990 to present in order to promote future conservation efforts and focus time and resources to the most sensitive areas of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "I’ve identified five areas within the city to be designated as “priority conservation areas.” A PCA will be defined as an area desirable to maintain or enhance through protection, restoration, or sustainable stewardship, such as an area with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Significant biodiversity (pocket prairie) (Mattive Open Space)\n",
    " \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "* Critical habitat for endangered or vulnerable species (bald eagle, snowy egret) (Ken Mitchell Open Space)\n",
    "\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "* Wildlife habitat (beavers, prairie dogs, raptors, owls, etc) (Morgan Smith Nature Area)\n",
    " \t\t\t\t\t \t\t\t\t\n",
    "* Land with historical agriculture use (Wagner-Mayhew)\n",
    " \t\t\t\t\t\t\n",
    "* Land that provides essential ecosystem services (Erger’s Pond)\n",
    "\n",
    "By analyzing the data, I can identify any significant changes in vegetation land cover, such as deforestation, reforestation, or changes in plant species. These changes can then be compared against historical data, identifying the important biotic and abiotic structures within each PCA's boundaries, such as rivers, streams, and wetlands. These structures play a critical role in the ecosystem and can provide insight into potential threats to the area."

    "## Data\n",
    "Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used to assess the greenness in the vegetation cover. The range of values obtained is between −1 and +1. Only positive values correspond to vegetated zones; the higher the index, the greater the chlorophyll content of the target.\n",
    "\n",
    "This index is important for agricultural drought monitoring, used to estimate crop yields, pasture performance, and rangeland carrying capacities, assess nutrient deficiencies, etc. Its value is directly related to percent of ground cover, photosynthetic activity of the plant, and surface water as well as others.\n",
    "\n",
    "NDVI calculations will be generated for each year in the study period (1990-2023) clipped to each of the 6 study areas using aerial imagery sourced from LandSat 5, 8, and 9 downloaded with USGS EarthExplorer. Supplemental data that will be used include City of Brighton native data stored within Brighton GIS department’s city-wide repository such as shapefiles, feature classes, and map layers such as elevation maps, roads and rails, watershed data, city owned parcel boundaries, parks property, farmable properties, bald eagle habitat information, and other relevant data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example code that connects to your home directory, downloads Landsat 8 imagery over the 34 year study period, clips it to 6 study areas, calculates NDVI for each image, generates an NDVI composite for each decade and study area, calculates the percent change in NDVI for each decade, and saves the rendered images in .tif, .gif, and .png file formats."
